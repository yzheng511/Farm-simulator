# My Personal Project

## Project Overview

This project contains an application that simulates the operation of a South American farm at
the second half of twentieth century. In the game, the player will have the chance to choose
between different agricultural corps and make the most profitable combination among them. As 
the game progresses, the player can expand the farm and eventually becomes the monopoly. 
Along with the basic economic decisions, there are also special events happening concurrently
with player's decisions. Some of them contains positive effects and some of them contains 
negative ones.

This application is intended for people who has interests of economics and business operations.
As the game integrates economic concepts into the basic game operation, players would be able to
touch some economic knowledge when playing the game. This application interests me because I am 
also interested in the economic concepts and business operations. As being a BUCS student, it is
valuable for me to integrate the knowledge from both sides in the project.
