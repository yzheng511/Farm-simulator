# My Personal Project

## Project Overview

This project contains an application that simulates the operation of a South American farm.
In the game, the player will have the chance to choose between different agricultural corps
and make the most profitable combination among them. As the game progresses, the player can 
expand the farm and eventually becomes the monopoly. 


This application is intended for people who has interests of economics and business operations.
As the game integrates economic concepts into the basic game operation, players would be able to
touch some economic knowledge when playing the game. This application interests me because I am 
also interested in the economic concepts and business operations. As being a BUCS student, it is
valuable for me to integrate the knowledge from both sides in the project.
